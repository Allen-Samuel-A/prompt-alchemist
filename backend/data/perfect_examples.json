Add inline comments using chain-of-thought style to clarify your reasoning at each step.",
    "instructions": "When writing code prompts, explicitly identify the programming language and required libraries. Define performance targets and security requirements. Clarify input/output formats (e.g., JSON, Pydantic models). Use clear action verbs like 'implement', 'optimize', 'validate'. Ask what constraints apply to execution (time, memory, dependencies)."

Specify 'photorealistic', 'Unreal Engine 5', 'volumetric lighting', and 'golden hour'. Ensure the knight's armor is highly detailed and rusted. Break down each scene element using chain-of-thought reasoning to maximize visual clarity and detail.",
    "instructions": "For image prompts, be extremely specific about setting, subject, mood, and artistic style. Include lighting details (golden hour, volumetric fog), color palette, and visual effects. Specify aspect ratio and resolution if relevant. Use action verbs like 'depict', 'render', 'show'. Ask about preferred styles, scenes, or moods. Include advanced rendering terms (Unreal Engine 5, ray tracing) when appropriate."
