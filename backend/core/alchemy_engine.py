### YOUR MISSION
The user has provided their requirements through a conversation. Your job is to TRANSFORM this into a 
professional, detailed, research-backed prompt that delivers excellent results.

You must ADD VALUE by:
- Making instructions more specific and actionable
- Adding relevant context and background
- Including best practices from research
- Providing clear success criteria
- Expanding with helpful details and examples

### CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You MUST output EXACTLY TWO sections with NOTHING ELSE:

Section 1: The Enhanced Prompt (starts with "### Prompt")
Section 2: The Explanation (starts with "---EXPLANATION---")

DO NOT include:
- Solution matrices or tables
- Recommended paths or strategies
- Code blocks or JSON
- Multiple prompt versions
- Any text before "### Prompt" or after the explanation

### PROMPT STRUCTURE
Every enhanced prompt MUST include these four components with SUBSTANTIAL DETAIL:

**Role:** [Expand on the AI's expertise - add specific skills, knowledge domains, and perspective]
**Task:** [Make the objective crystal clear with specific deliverables and success criteria]
**Context:** [Add relevant background, audience details, use case scenarios, and environmental factors]
**Constraints:** [Expand with quality standards, format requirements, style guidelines, and boundaries]

### TARGETED INSTRUCTIONS AND PERFECT EXAMPLE ({category_title.upper()})
1. Follow the '{category_title}' example structure and level of detail precisely.
2. Ensure the generated prompt includes the specific instructions below:
{category_instructions}

### RESEARCH-BACKED GUIDELINES FOR {target_model.upper()}
{research}

### USER'S REQUIREMENTS FROM CONVERSATION
{user_idea}

### STRICT FORMATTING RULES
1. Start IMMEDIATELY with "### Prompt" (no preamble)
2. ENHANCE each of the 4 components with specific, actionable details
3. Make it comprehensive and production-ready
4. Add "---EXPLANATION---" after the prompt
5. Write 2-4 sentences explaining what enhancements you made
6. STOP after explanation - add nothing else

EXAMPLE OF GOOD OUTPUT:
### Prompt
**Role:** You are a professional HR communication specialist with expertise in crafting diplomatic resignation letters that maintain positive relationships and professional reputation.

**Task:** Compose a formal resignation letter that clearly communicates the decision to leave, expresses gratitude for opportunities received, offers appropriate transition support, and maintains a respectful, professional tone throughout.

**Context:** This letter will be sent to the employee's direct supervisor and HR department. It needs to be formal yet warm, brief but complete, and should leave the door open for future professional connections. The employee wants to leave on good terms and maintain their professional reputation.

**Constraints:** Keep the letter to 150-200 words, use professional business letter formatting, maintain a positive and grateful tone throughout, avoid any negative comments or reasons for leaving, include a clear last working day (2 weeks from date), offer to help with transition, and end with appreciation for the experience gained.

---EXPLANATION---
This prompt transforms the basic request into a comprehensive guide by specifying professional expertise, defining all deliverables with clear tone requirements, providing crucial context about recipients and goals, and establishing specific constraints to ensure a polished, professional result.

Now create the enhanced prompt following this exact format."""
